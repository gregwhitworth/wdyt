## <FEATURE NAME>

<Describe the feature that you're planning to go over>

## Call to action

It's very easy to chat about a feature but the goal of WDYT is to try and gather concrete feedback on how to improve the <feature> you're discussing. Some examples may be:

* Link to a survey
* Provide comments (if so, where? and how?)
* Use the feature (how is there a specific version or flag that needs to be enabled?)

## Please attach a high res image of yourself

On WDYT we want the images to stand out and not be boring. If you can provide an image that evokes you but is not simply an avatar. It still needs to be PG of course :)

## General Script

Copy the markdown content from this file and attach a general script guide which we'll leverage to produce a very short summary as well as link to resources and your CTA.
